Haven Core
==========

Your job
--------
You are the captain of a crawler on the post-apolyptic Earth, some miljon years B.C. Thousand and thousand of years ago the atmosphere gave up, and the strong solar rays started destroying earth instead of warming it up. Volcano raptures, earthquakes was the begninning, acidious geysrs started showing up, a new fenomenon. Humankind did survive, but there where not many humans left. The ones that survived soon fled into underground cities where they where protected from the now slightly poisionus atmosphere. 
That was thousands of years ago.
Today the atmosphere is highly hazardous, a couple of seconds out in the open without protection would probably kill you right away. Humans living in the underground cities leaving the surface to its own. Almost to its own.
As a captain of a crawler - a huge ugly vehicle - you crawl the surface hunting for minerals, buried treasures and most important - awesomium, the big energy source of the Haven Core world. 
So get ready captain, rally your crew, make sure to have the perfect mix among your crew members, make sure to put some guns on your crawler and most important of all - make sure that the Haven Core in your vehicle is operating at all times, without it the deadly particles in the atmoshpere will penetrate, and destroy not only the crawler but probably all of the crew as well.

So get ready captain, and dive into the wonderful posinous acidic world of Haven Core!
